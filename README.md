#DESCRIPTION:My domain is **UI/UX design**, and I worked on designing a **Voice-Controlled App Interface** using Figma. This task involved creating an intuitive and accessible user interface that allows users to interact with the app through voice commands. I designed key elements such as a **microphone activation button, voice feedback animations, and command recognition indicators** to enhance user engagement. The interface was structured to provide real-time visual feedback, ensuring users know when the app is actively listening and processing their requests.  

This task helped me understand the importance of **accessibility, user guidance, and seamless interaction design** in voice-controlled applications. Working in Figma allowed me to prototype voice interactions effectively and collaborate with developers to ensure a smooth integration between design and functionality.
